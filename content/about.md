# Who am I?

I’m Diego and I’m a software engineer who has a taken an interest in procedural
modelling around 2012 when I started my PhD. Now I want to contribute to the
open source community with implementations of stuff I have learnt.

# What is this page about?

One of my pet projects is Pagoda which is a graph based framework for general
purpose 3D procedural modelling. I want this page to be a collection of my
development work in Pagoda and examples of how it can be used to create
content.

Occasionally, I might also write about C++ and general software engineering
stuff, but I’ll try to keep it related to Pagoda.
