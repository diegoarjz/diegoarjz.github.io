Welcome to the Procedural Recipes page! This is the first post in this blog and also my first blog post ever.

I don't know if people actually ever read the first post in a blog unless it is already packed with interesting stuff. It's not the case here... This post is merely a copy of the [about page](/about) but starting to post without at least introducing myself didn't fell right.

### Who am I?

I'm Diego and I'm a C++ developer who's had a keen interest in procedural
modelling since around 2012 when I started my PhD. Now I want to contribute to
the open source community with implementations of stuff I have learnt.

### What is this page about?

One of my pet projects is [Pagoda](https://github.com/diegoarjz/pagoda)
which is a graph based framework for general purpose 3D procedural modelling.
I want this page to be a collection of my development work in Pagoda and examples of how it can be used to create content.

I will also keep a list of other projects in and around procedural modelling.

Occasionally, I might also write about C++ and general software engineering stuff, but I'll try to keep it related to Pagoda.
